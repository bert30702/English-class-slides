## What is food waste?

----

- It is not only food intended for consumption that is  discarded along the food supply chain and cannot be used.

## Global Overview

----

- Food Loss and Waste is a Global Issue

----

![](https://i.imgur.com/NwbK2Ni.jpg)

----

- Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted.

----

- Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes).

----


- Take cereals for example
  286 million tonnes of cereal product are thrown away per year, which is equivalent to 763 billion boxes of pasta. 
  9 million people died because of starvation in 2015.
  Using simple math,we could have saved this kind of cute kids 232 times.

- As long as people save 25% of food waste, people around the world can be fed well

## Food Waste in Taiwan

----

----

![](https://i.imgur.com/OqhzimC.jpg)

  Due to commercial profits, farmers would rather produce more (but taking a risk) than save resources.

----

- Market

  All Taiwan supermarkets and mass merchandisers produce more than 500 metric tons of kitchen waste per month.

## Solution

----

- Education

- Technology

  "Food Redistribution, Re-sharing and Re-use"
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/HqO78yA.png)


----

- France: Legislation

  In 2016, France clarified regulations requiring large supermarkets to donate unsold goods.
  Italy passed a bill in 2016 to encourage supermarkets to donate food and simplify the donation process and low deduction tax. It will allow the life of the leftover food to continue.

----

- Hong Kong: Food Waste Investigation

  An investigator will be assigned to a restaurant to    measure and classify food waste into groups, and he will   come up with a solution to increase the efficiency of  the use of food.

----

- Germany: Intelligent Packaging

  Make people realize if the food should be thrown away.

- Taiwan: Food Sharing Project / FoodBank / Foodsaver
 
  Many youtubers also devote themselves into this project.   e.g. 臺客劇場 理科太太

- What is food waste 

  Is it the food that we can't eat anymore or is it us who don't know how to fully utilize this resource?

----

![](https://i.imgur.com/hoSqyKv.jpg =600x500)

----

- Why should we be aware of this problem?

  Maybe life now is confortable, but what will happen in the future when we have 9.6 billion people sharing the same amount of resource by 2050.
